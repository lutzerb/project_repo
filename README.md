# project_repo

This is the Graz Machine Learning course repository for the final project

Made by

* Bernhard Lutzer
* Bianca Koeck

Two files are missing in the github because they are too large (approx 500 MB). 
We tried Git-LFS, but this does not work for repos which are a fork of another repo which does not contain any LFS.
Therfore you find those files here:

https://we.tl/t-VsuWJPvbIW

It is a .csv which should be put into data/raw
and a .pkl which should be put into data/clean
